# What's New in SHIELD-Authenticator

## Version 2.0 - January 7, 2026

### 🔐 Major New Feature: End-to-End Encrypted Vault

**Your 2FA codes are now protected with military-grade End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)!**

We've implemented a powerful new security feature with **End-to-End Encryption** that encrypts all your authenticator accounts with a password you choose. This means your data is encrypted on your device before it ever reaches our servers, and even if someone gains access to our servers, your 2FA secrets remain completely private and unreadable without your password.

### What's New for You

#### 🔒 **Password-Protected Vault**

- **Lock your accounts with a password**: Choose a secure password (at least 8 characters) to encrypt all your 2FA codes
- **Your password never leaves your device**: We can't see or recover your password - it stays 100% private on your phone/computer
- **Change or remove your password anytime**: Full control over your vault security in Settings
- **Works without a password too**: You can choose not to use a password if you prefer (not recommended)

#### 🆘 **Account Recovery Questions**

- **Never lose access**: Set up 3 security questions to recover your vault if you forget your password
- **Simple questions, big security**: Answer questions like "What's your first pet's name?" to restore access
- **Complete privacy**: Your answers are encrypted and stored securely
- **Reset your passphrase**: Use the "Recover Vault" option on the unlock screen to reset your forgotten passphrase by answering your recovery questions
- **Set a new passphrase**: After successful recovery, you'll create a new passphrase to unlock your vault

#### 📤 **Enhanced Backup & Import**

- **Encrypt your backups**: When exporting your accounts to CSV, you can now add password protection
- **Import protected backups**: Easily restore password-protected CSV files
- **Your choice**: Use encryption or export without it - you decide

#### ⚡ **Improved Settings**

- **New Vault section**: Manage your vault password and recovery questions all in one place
- **Clear status display**: Always know if your vault is protected or not
- **Easy recovery**: If you forget your password, use your security questions to regain access
- **Change Passphrase**: Update your vault passphrase while unlocked
- **Better organization**: All security and privacy settings in one convenient location

### How Vault Recovery Works

1. **Forgot Your Passphrase?** Click "Recover Vault" on the unlock screen
2. **Answer Your Questions**: Enter the exact answers to your security questions
3. **Set New Passphrase**: Create a new passphrase (min 8 characters)
4. **Access Restored**: Your vault unlocks with the new passphrase
5. **All Data Intact**: Your encrypted accounts remain secure and accessible

### Important Things to Know

⚠️ **Please Read Carefully:**

- If you set a vault password and forget it (and don't set up recovery questions), your encrypted accounts cannot be recovered
- Recovery question answers must be exact - watch out for spaces and capital letters
- Your vault password is encrypted on your device before anything is stored
- We recommend setting up recovery questions when you create a vault password

### What This Means for You

✅ **Maximum Privacy**: Your 2FA secrets are encrypted before they ever leave your device  
✅ **You're in Control**: Only you have the key to unlock your accounts  
✅ **Peace of Mind**: Even in a data breach, your accounts stay protected  
✅ **Easy to Use**: Set it up once in Settings and forget about it  
✅ **Flexible**: Choose the security level that works for you
